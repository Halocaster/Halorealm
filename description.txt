Halorealm is a brand new mod that offers a variety of powerful items and strong enemies to kill.

This mod is currently W.I.P. and unfinished. Some of the items does not have 'recipes' or 'buy values'.
I will add new items and eventually, enemies every day, but without sprites. I'm looking for someone to help me make this mod a reality.
I do not recommend to download this mod until it is released. (Some of the sprites are placeholders)
