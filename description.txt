Halorealm offers a wide variety of new items to get and strong monsters to kill. This mod aims to expand the gameplay of Terraria to make it more fun and enjoyable. This mod primarily focuses on adding new features, items, enemies and bosses to the game while keeping the vanilla experience for the players. The developer of the mod (Halocaster) is currently making pre-hardmode items and enemies. 

This mod is currently W.I.P. and unfinished. Some of the items does not have 'recipes', 'AIs' or 'buy values'.
I will add new items and eventually, enemies every day, but without sprites. I'm looking for someone to help me make this mod a reality.
I do not recommend to download this mod until it is released. (Some of the sprites are placeholders)
I am making new items everyday without sprites. I'm looking for someone who will help me.
